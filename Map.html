            <div class="guide-content">
                <p>Please cite the following paper when using the maps - Mittal, S., Park, S., Chester, M. V., Huber, M., Romero, N., Avner, P., Jones, N. K. W., & Ukkusuri, S. V. (under review). <em>Commuting in the heat: A comprehensive review of extreme temperature impacts on transport users, behavioral adaptations and mitigation strategies.</em> Manuscript submitted for publication in <em>Transport Reviews</em>.</p>
                <p>Here's how to use the Atlas:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Click on any colored dot to view detailed information about heat impacts or adaptation strategies, their sources, and locations.</li>
                    <li>Use the toggle in the top right to switch between viewing "Impacts" (heat-related problems) and "Adaptations" (solutions being implemented).</li>
                    <li>Use the filters to select specific transportation modes.</li>
                    <li>The colors indicate the number of impacts or adaptations observed in each location, from cyan (fewer) to red (more).</li>
                    <li>When you click a location, all areas with the same Köppen climate classification will be highlighted, showing climate pattern similarities.</li>
                    <li>Adjust the map zoom to explore impacts and adaptations at different geographical scales.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><em>The impacts and adaptation strategies displayed are collected from research papers published until August 2024.</em></p>
